  summary: "I'm an 18 year old college junior studying computer science and statistics with a passion for solving problems, learning intricate concepts, and building products. I was first exposed to coding when I was 10. Solving problems by converting my thoughts to tangible results in languages that feel incredibly cryptic has been one of the most amazing feelings ever!",
  summary2: "I grew up with a deep passion for mathematics, and continue to use bayesian statistics to read the world around me. I have won awards at prestigious hackathons such as HackMIT 2024 and SFHacks 2024. When I'm not coding, I'm probably cycling until I run out of roads",
